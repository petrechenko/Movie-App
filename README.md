# Movie-App
A small website hosted on Heroku: https://petrean-movie-app.herokuapp.com/

That's my practice on using jQuery and ajax and a specific way of using GoogleMaps API.

I used OMDB API for a fast looking up the movie you are interested in.
I also used GoogleMaps API to find your current location and find all the movie theaters next to you with their addresses and ratings.
On the main page you will be able to take notes about the movies you liked or not.
